      <h1>Treating Merchants Like Objects</h1>
      <p>
        Now that it&#39;s safely in the rearview, I can see how great module one&#39;s final project is for synthesizing the smaller components of programming in Ruby into a bigger picture. It&#39;s easy to learn the syntax for most of the language, but it takes a real leap to use these ideas towards an actually desirable end. Black Thursday is that leap, and it lays the groundwork for using object-oriented programming to interact with data in some pretty awesome ways.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think graphical representations of data structures&#8212;like trees, for instance&#8212;can make the object-oriented approach a little foggier than it needs to be. They did for me, at least. In trying to confront the problem of the binary search tree, I imagined storing the entire dataset as some kind of hierarchical hash, and I couldn&#39;t imagine how a structure like that could make for anything close to efficient analysis.
        <br>
        <br>
        The problem of sorting data from an online retailer made the whole process clearer&#8212;it&#39;s way more intuitive to think of a merchant or an invoice as an object than a bit of raw data, and it&#39;s easier still to imagine what sort of actions these objects should be able to perform. And when you approach a problem with this in mind, the path to a solution is a lot easier to follow&#8212;your data is already sorted in a way that&#39;s easy to remember (and access) even as the project expands.

        Understanding how to efficiently make objects interact with each other opened the floodgates for imagining the scope of the cool stuff I&#39;ll be able to do with programming&#8212;I found music APIs that can analyze a song in more ways than humans are capable of hearing, machine learning APIs that can use that data to generate new songs, and even an API that allows you to flawlessly superimpose a mustache on a photo of yourself, regardless of whether or not you have facial hair. Dealing with these huge sets of data isn&#39;t as intimidating now that I have a framework for managing them, and I can finally start to use my energy to think about novel applications for them instead.
